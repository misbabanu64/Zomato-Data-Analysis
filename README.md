Introduction to the Project: Get an overview of the Zomato data analysis project and its objectives.

🛠️ Data Collection: Learn how to gather and preprocess the Zomato dataset for analysis.

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Dive into EDA techniques to understand the dataset, identify patterns, and detect anomalies.

📈 Data Visualization: Discover how to create insightful visualizations to effectively communicate your findings.

📊 Statistical Analysis: Apply statistical methods to analyze the data and extract meaningful insights.

🤖 Machine Learning Models: Build and evaluate machine learning models to predict key metrics and trends.

🔗 Real-World Applications: Understand the practical applications of your analysis in the food and restaurant industry.

📝 Project Summary: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis.

Python and its following libraries are used to analyze Zomato data.

Numpy– With Numpy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently.
Matplotlib– It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
Pandas– The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.
Seaborn– It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics. 

To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:

Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?
Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?
What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?

	What type of restaurant do the majority of customers order from?
 How many votes has each type of restaurant received from customers?
 What are the ratings that the majority of restaurants have received?
 Zomato has observed that most couples order most of their food online. What is their average spending on each order?
Which mode (online or offline) has received the maximum rating?Which type of restaurant received more offline orders, so that Zomato can provide those
customers with some good offers?

CONCLUSION:
Dining restaurants primarily accept offline orders, whereas cafes primarily receive online orders. This suggests that clients prefer to place orders in person at restaurants, but prefer online ordering at cafes.
